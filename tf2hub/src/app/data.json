      "\"CFG.TF is a free open-source cross-platform Team Fortress 2 config generator. Even if TF2 is an old game, it has gone through so much updates and patches that it is now nearly impossible to make it run at constant 120+ frames per second on mid-tier PC. And that is absolutely required for playing fast paced shooter comfortably. Ever dreamed of optimizing your game experience in just a few clicks? Well, here is your chance. This app generates a set of premade settings that helps your game to run faster and smoother.\""
