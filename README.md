# TF2Hub.com
Hello there! This is the code for the tf2hub.com website, written in Angular 10. Feel free to take a look around and add issues if you run into any problems.

To run the site locally, you'll need the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/). Just follow the directions in the README file under the `tf2hub` folder.

Please let me know what you think after you've had a chance to look around. Thanks, and have fun!
